# Japanese Quiz Solver - QuizzWiz/QuizSolver Enhancement Plan

## Current Status ✅
Your project already has most core features of QuizzWiz/QuizSolver AI:
- ✅ Screen capture and OCR
- ✅ AI-powered answers (Gemini + OpenAI)
- ✅ Real-time processing
- ✅ Japanese language support
- ✅ Interactive region selection
- ✅ Always-on-top GUI

## Recommended Enhancements 🚀

### 1. Multi-Provider AI Support
**Goal**: Support more AI providers like QuizzWiz
```python
# Add to config.py
SUPPORTED_PROVIDERS = {
    "gemini": "google-generativeai",
    "openai": "openai", 
    "claude": "anthropic",
    "cohere": "cohere",
    "huggingface": "transformers"
}
```

### 2. Answer Confidence Scoring
**Goal**: Rate answer reliability like professional quiz solvers
```python
# Add confidence analysis
def analyze_confidence(question, answer):
    confidence_factors = {
        "text_clarity": ocr_confidence,
        "question_completeness": question_analysis,
        "ai_certainty": response_confidence
    }
    return overall_confidence_score
```

### 3. Question Type Detection
**Goal**: Identify multiple choice, fill-in-blank, true/false
```python
QUESTION_TYPES = {
    "multiple_choice": ["A)", "B)", "C)", "D)", "①", "②", "③", "④"],
    "true_false": ["True", "False", "正", "誤", "はい", "いいえ"],
    "fill_blank": ["____", "（　　）", "［　　］"],
    "essay": ["explain", "describe", "なぜ", "説明"]
}
```

### 4. Answer History and Analytics
**Goal**: Track performance and improvement over time
```python
# Add answer logging
class AnswerHistory:
    def __init__(self):
        self.history = []
        
    def log_answer(self, question, answer, confidence, timestamp):
        # Store in SQLite database
        pass
        
    def get_analytics(self):
        # Return success rate, common topics, etc.
        pass
```

### 5. Hotkey Support
**Goal**: Quick capture without clicking buttons
```python
import keyboard

# Global hotkeys
keyboard.add_hotkey('ctrl+shift+q', capture_and_solve)
keyboard.add_hotkey('ctrl+shift+r', select_region)
keyboard.add_hotkey('ctrl+shift+h', show_history)
```

### 6. Enhanced OCR Preprocessing
**Goal**: Better text recognition accuracy
```python
def advanced_preprocessing(image):
    # Noise reduction
    image = cv2.fastNlMeansDenoising(image)
    
    # Adaptive thresholding
    image = cv2.adaptiveThreshold(image, 255, cv2.ADAPTIVE_THRESH_GAUSSIAN_C, cv2.THRESH_BINARY, 11, 2)
    
    # Morphological operations
    kernel = cv2.getStructuringElement(cv2.MORPH_RECT, (2, 2))
    image = cv2.morphologyEx(image, cv2.MORPH_CLOSE, kernel)
    
    return image
```

### 7. Multi-Language Detection
**Goal**: Auto-detect and handle multiple languages
```python
from langdetect import detect

def auto_detect_language(text):
    detected = detect(text)
    if detected == 'ja':
        return 'jpn+eng'
    elif detected == 'ko':
        return 'kor+eng'
    else:
        return 'eng'
```

### 8. Smart Context Awareness
**Goal**: Remember previous questions for context
```python
class ContextManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.context_window = []
        
    def add_context(self, question, answer):
        self.context_window.append({"q": question, "a": answer})
        if len(self.context_window) > 5:
            self.context_window.pop(0)
            
    def get_context_prompt(self):
        return "Previous Q&A context: " + str(self.context_window)
```

### 9. Advanced UI Features
**Goal**: Professional interface like QuizzWiz
- Answer confidence visualization (progress bars)
- Question type indicators
- Performance statistics dashboard
- Dark/light theme toggle
- Customizable hotkeys panel
- Export answers to PDF/CSV

### 10. Plugin System
**Goal**: Extensibility for different subjects/languages
```python
class PluginManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.plugins = {}
        
    def register_plugin(self, name, plugin):
        self.plugins[name] = plugin
        
    def get_specialized_prompt(self, subject):
        if subject in self.plugins:
            return self.plugins[subject].get_prompt()
```
