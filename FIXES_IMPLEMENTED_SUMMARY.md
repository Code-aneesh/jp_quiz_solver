**Improvements Made:**
- **Background Error Handler**: `handle_background_error()` method for thread error management
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues operating when individual components fail
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Clear error messages displayed in GUI without technical details
- **Error Logging**: All errors properly logged with context information
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Automatic retry for transient failures (network, API rate limits)
- **Fallback Systems**: Automatic switching to backup AI providers on failure
