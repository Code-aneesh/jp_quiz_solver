- ✅ Multiple setup methods (batch, PowerShell)
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Quick-start launcher

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Modular design** - separate concerns (UI, OCR, AI, config)
- **Thread-safe operations** - background capture doesn't block UI
- **Provider abstraction** - easy switching between AI services
- **Configuration-driven** - customizable without code changes

### Key Technologies
- **mss** - Fast, cross-platform screen capture
- **pytesseract** - OCR with Japanese language support
- **PIL (Pillow)** - Image processing and enhancement
- **tkinter** - Native Python GUI framework
- **google-generativeai** - Gemini API integration
- **openai** - OpenAI API integration (optional)

### Performance Optimizations
- **Image preprocessing** - 2x upscaling, contrast enhancement, sharpening
- **Change detection** - only process new text to save API calls
- **Efficient capture** - configurable polling interval
- **Memory management** - proper resource cleanup

## 🚀 How to Use

### Quick Start
1. **Install Tesseract OCR** with Japanese language pack
2. **Run setup script**: `./setup.ps1` or `setup.bat`
3. **Set API key**: Follow setup prompts or set GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable
4. **Launch app**: `python main.py` or `run.bat`
5. **Select region**: Click "Select Region" and drag around quiz area
6. **Start learning**: App automatically detects and processes Japanese text

### Configuration
- Edit `config.py` to change AI provider, paths, or OCR settings
- Set environment variables for API keys (more secure than config file)
- Customize capture region, polling interval, and OCR parameters

## 🎯 Use Cases

### Perfect For
- Japanese language practice and study
- Vocabulary learning with instant translations
- Grammar explanation and analysis
- Self-paced learning with immediate feedback

### Not For
- Monitored exams or assessments (explicitly prohibited)
- Commercial use without proper licensing
- Real-time conversation (designed for text-based content)

## 🛠️ Maintenance

The project is feature-complete but can be extended with:
- Additional AI providers (Claude, Cohere, etc.)
- OCR confidence scoring and fallback methods
- Answer history and logging
- Flashcard generation from detected questions
- Multiple language support beyond Japanese

## 📊 Project Stats

- **Lines of Code**: ~450 (main.py: 200, config.py: 25, setup scripts: 150, docs: 75)
- **Dependencies**: 4 core + optional OpenAI
- **Setup Time**: 5-10 minutes with automated scripts
- **Supported Platforms**: Windows 10/11 (can be adapted for Linux/macOS)
- **AI Providers**: Gemini (default), OpenAI (optional)
