# üèÆ Ultimate Japanese Quiz Solver - Strategic Development Roadmap

## üéØ Vision Statement
Create the world's most accurate and comprehensive Japanese quiz detection and solving system, rivaling commercial language learning platforms while maintaining open-source accessibility.

## üìä Current Status Assessment
**Phase 1 Completed:**
- ‚úÖ Enhanced OCR with multi-PSM optimization
- ‚úÖ Rule-based engines (date conversion, fuzzy katakana)
- ‚úÖ Structured LLM integration with JSON validation
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive testing framework
- ‚úÖ Professional GUI with threading

**Current Limitations Identified:**
1. **Context Understanding**: Limited semantic comprehension beyond rule matching
2. **Learning Capability**: No adaptive learning from user corrections
3. **Answer Confidence**: Basic confidence scoring without uncertainty quantification
4. **Performance Scaling**: Not optimized for batch processing or real-time streaming
5. **Knowledge Coverage**: Limited specialized vocabulary domains (medical, legal, technical)

2. **Semantic Vector Processing**
   - Implement sentence-BERT for Japanese (sonoisa/sentence-bert-base-ja-mean-tokens)
   - Build semantic similarity matching for answer options
   - Context-aware embedding generation
   - Cross-reference with knowledge graphs

3. **Advanced Confidence Scoring**
   - Bayesian uncertainty quantification
